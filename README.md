# WhydahGally-LSTM-MLP
Machine Learning Tool with LSTM and MLP Neural Networks, with CUDA implementation.

At the moment there are two MLPs and one LSTM but it is possible to add other machine learning tools.

It is possible to use this tool with CUDA or completely without it: switching off the relative preprocessor option.

The LSTM is mainly based on the design of nicodjimenez. Here the explanation: http://nicodjimenez.github.io/2014/08/08/lstm.html
